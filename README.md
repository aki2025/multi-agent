This code is a Streamlit-based web application that demonstrates a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach using multiple large language models (LLMs) to answer a user's question. The app sends the user's query to several open-source LLMs, collects their responses, and then aggregates these responses into a single, high-quality answer using another LLM (the "aggregator model").

Here’s a detailed breakdown of what the code does:

1. Setup and Imports


import streamlit as st
import asyncio
import os
from together import AsyncTogether, Together
Streamlit: Used to create the web app interface.

asyncio: Enables asynchronous programming to handle multiple LLM calls concurrently.

os: Used to set environment variables (e.g., API key).

together: A library for interacting with the Together API, which provides access to various LLMs.

2. Streamlit App Setup


st.title("Mixture-of-Agents LLM App")
Sets the title of the Streamlit app.

3. API Key Input


together_api_key = st.text_input("Enter your Together API Key:", type="password")
Prompts the user to input their Together API key, which is required to access the LLMs.

4. Initialize Together Client


if together_api_key:
    os.environ["TOGETHER_API_KEY"] = together_api_key
    client = Together(api_key=together_api_key)
    async_client = AsyncTogether(api_key=together_api_key)
If the API key is provided, it is stored in the environment variable TOGETHER_API_KEY.

Initializes synchronous (client) and asynchronous (async_client) Together API clients.

5. Define Models


reference_models = [
    "Qwen/Qwen2-72B-Instruct",
    "Qwen/Qwen1.5-72B-Chat",
    "mistralai/Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1",
    "databricks/dbrx-instruct",
]
aggregator_model = "mistralai/Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1"
reference_models: A list of LLMs that will generate individual responses to the user's query.

aggregator_model: The LLM that will aggregate the responses from the reference models into a final answer.

6. Aggregator System Prompt


aggregator_system_prompt = """You have been provided with a set of responses from various open-source models to the latest user query. Your task is to synthesize these responses into a single, high-quality response. It is crucial to critically evaluate the information provided in these responses, recognizing that some of it may be biased or incorrect. Your response should not simply replicate the given answers but should offer a refined, accurate, and comprehensive reply to the instruction. Ensure your response is well-structured, coherent, and adheres to the highest standards of accuracy and reliability. Responses from models:"""
Defines the system prompt for the aggregator model, instructing it to synthesize and refine the responses from the reference models.

7. User Input


user_prompt = st.text_input("Enter your question:")
Prompts the user to input their question.

8. Asynchronous Function to Run LLMs


async def run_llm(model):
    """Run a single LLM call with a reference model."""
    response = await async_client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_prompt}],
        temperature=0.7,
        max_tokens=512,
    )
    return model, response.choices[0].message.content
Asynchronously sends the user's query to a specific LLM and retrieves its response.

Returns the model name and its response.

9. Main Function to Handle LLM Calls and Aggregation


async def main():
    results = await asyncio.gather(*[run_llm(model) for model in reference_models])
    
    # Display individual model responses
    st.subheader("Individual Model Responses:")
    for model, response in results:
        with st.expander(f"Response from {model}"):
            st.write(response)
    
    # Aggregate responses
    st.subheader("Aggregated Response:")
    finalStream = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=aggregator_model,
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": aggregator_system_prompt},
            {"role": "user", "content": ",".join(response for _, response in results)},
        ],
        stream=True,
    )
    
    # Display aggregated response
    response_container = st.empty()
    full_response = ""
    for chunk in finalStream:
        content = chunk.choices[0].delta.content or ""
        full_response += content
        response_container.markdown(full_response + "▌")
    response_container.markdown(full_response)
Step 1: Sends the user's query to all reference models concurrently using asyncio.gather.

Step 2: Displays each model's response in an expandable section.

Step 3: Aggregates all responses using the aggregator model and streams the final response to the user.

10. Trigger the Main Function


if st.button("Get Answer"):
    if user_prompt:
        asyncio.run(main())
    else:
        st.warning("Please enter a question.")
When the user clicks the "Get Answer" button, the app checks if a question has been entered.

If a question is provided, it runs the main function to generate and display responses.

11. Sidebar Information


st.sidebar.title("About this app")
st.sidebar.write(
    "This app demonstrates a Mixture-of-Agents approach using multiple Language Models (LLMs) "
    "to answer a single question."
)

st.sidebar.subheader("How it works:")
st.sidebar.markdown(
    """
    1. The app sends your question to multiple LLMs:
        - Qwen/Qwen2-72B-Instruct
        - Qwen/Qwen1.5-72B-Chat
        - mistralai/Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1
        - databricks/dbrx-instruct
    2. Each model provides its own response
    3. All responses are then aggregated using Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1
    4. The final aggregated response is displayed
    """
)

st.sidebar.write(
    "This approach allows for a more comprehensive and balanced answer by leveraging multiple AI models."
)
Adds a sidebar to the app with information about how the app works and the models used.
