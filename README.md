This code is a Streamlit-based web application that demonstrates a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach using multiple large language models (LLMs) to answer a user's question. The app sends the user's query to several open-source LLMs, collects their responses, and then aggregates these responses into a single, high-quality answer using another LLM (the "aggregator model").

Here’s a detailed breakdown of what the code does:

5. Define Models

7. Aggregator System Prompt

7. User Input

8. Asynchronous Function to Run LLMs

9. Main Function to Handle LLM Calls and Aggregation

<img width="613" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b718f4b-8c83-4ab8-a13b-659faf694e5f" />

       
        # Display aggregated response
        response_container = st.empty()
        full_response = ""
        for chunk in finalStream:
            content = chunk.choices[0].delta.content or ""
            full_response += content
            response_container.markdown(full_response + "▌")
        response_container.markdown(full_response)
   
Step 1: Sends the user's query to all reference models concurrently using asyncio.gather.

Step 2: Displays each model's response in an expandable section.

Step 3: Aggregates all responses using the aggregator model and streams the final response to the user.


10. Trigger the Main Function

    If a question is provided, it runs the main function to generate and display responses.

11. Sidebar Information

What Does This App Do?

User Interaction:
    The user enters their Together API key and a question.
    
    The app sends the question to multiple LLMs and retrieves their responses.

Aggregation:

    The app uses another LLM to synthesize the individual responses into a single, high-quality answer.

Display:

    The app displays both the individual responses and the final aggregated response.

Key Features
    Mixture-of-Agents (MoA): Combines responses from multiple LLMs to provide a more comprehensive answer.
    
    Asynchronous Processing: Handles multiple LLM calls concurrently for faster responses.
    
    Streaming Output: Streams the final aggregated response to the user in real-time.

User-Friendly Interface:     Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.

How to Run the App

Install the required libraries:

    pip install streamlit together
    Save the code to a file (e.g., app.py).
    Run the app:
    streamlit agents-main.py
    Enter your Together API key and a question to see the app in action.
    This app is a great example of how to leverage multiple LLMs to improve the quality and reliability of AI-generated responses
